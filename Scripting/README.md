<h1>Scripting</h1>
<p>Scripting refers to the process of writing scripts, which are sets of instructions or commands that are executed by a computer program or scripting engine. Scripts are typically written in scripting languages, which are high-level programming languages designed for tasks that involve the automation of specific actions or processes.</p>

<p> > Automation: Scripts are commonly used to automate repetitive tasks or processes. For example, a script might be created to automate file backups, data processing, or system maintenance.
Web Development: In web development, scripting languages like JavaScript are used to create dynamic and interactive elements on websites. These scripts run on the client-side (in the user's browser) and enhance the user experience.
