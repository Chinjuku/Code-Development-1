<h1>Scripting</h1>
<p>Bash (Bourne Again SHell) defines its own scripting language and incorporates syntax from other shells like Korn Shell (ksh) or C Shell (csh). The language supports various features such as control structures, variables, and functions. Many commands commonly used in the console can be utilized in Bash scripts, making it versatile for scripting purposes. While Bash has its syntax, it shares similarities with other Unix-like shells, allowing for the adaptation of commands and concepts across different shell environments. It's important to consider portability when writing scripts for different Unix-like systems.</p>
