# Scripting

Scripting refers to the process of writing scripts, which are sets of instructions or commands that are executed by a computer program or scripting engine. Scripts are typically written in scripting languages, which are high-level programming languages designed for tasks that involve the automation of specific actions or processes.

- Automation : Scripts are commonly used to automate repetitive tasks or processes. For example, a script might be created to automate file backups, data processing, or system maintenance.
- Web Development: In web development, scripting languages like JavaScript are used to create dynamic and interactive elements on websites. These scripts run on the client-side (in the user's browser) and enhance the user experience.
-   System Administration: System administrators use scripts to automate routine tasks such as system backups, log file analysis, and software installations.
-   Game Development: Scripting is frequently employed in game development to control various aspects of the game, including character behavior, game events, and user interactions.
- Data Analysis: Scripts are commonly used in data analysis and scientific computing to process and analyze large datasets efficiently.
- Networking: Scripts can be used for network automation, configuring network devices, monitoring network activity, and other networking tasks.
Scripting languages are often interpreted rather than compiled, meaning that the scripts are executed line by line by an interpreter rather than being translated into machine code beforehand. This provides flexibility and ease of use but can come at the cost of execution speed compared to compiled languages. Examples of scripting languages include Python, Ruby, JavaScript, PowerShell, and Bash. Each scripting language is designed for specific use cases and has its own syntax and features.
 

# **What is a Shell?**

Before jumping into shell scripting, it’s necessary to understand what shell is. A shell is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input device such as a keyboard or a file to execute programs, create files, etc.

Whenever a user opens up the terminal (a console to a shell), the shell issues a command prompt where you’ll type your input. That input is further executed as you hit the Enter key, displaying the output on the terminal.

You can see below that the kernel communicates between the hardware and software throughout the shell script workflow

## Principle of Scripting

-   Automate Repetitive Tasks:
	Role: Enable the automation of repetitive tasks without the need to repeatedly type commands. This helps save time and reduces errors.
Example: Automating data backups, executing recurring commands, or streamlining routine tasks.

-   System Management:
Role: Facilitate convenient management of Linux systems without directly accessing the Terminal.
Example: User administration, configuring system settings, or installing and updating software.

-   Enhance Efficiency:
Role: Speed up the execution of tasks without waiting for user responses.
Example: Automating processes to complete tasks more quickly and efficiently.
-   Collaborate with Other Programs:
